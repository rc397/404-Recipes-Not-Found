# Contributing to 404 Recipes Not Found

## The easiest way to contribute
1. Add a new Markdown file under `docs/recipes/`.
2. Use the template: `docs/recipes/recipe-template.md`.
3. Add your new recipe link to `docs/recipes.md`.

## Style guidelines
- Keep it funny and readable.
- “Stack traces” can be fake.
- Keep it PG-13.

## Local preview (optional)
If you have Ruby/Jekyll installed you can preview, but it’s not required.
GitHub Pages will build the `docs/` folder automatically if configured.

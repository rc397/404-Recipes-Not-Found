# 404 Recipes Not Found

A parody cookbook of failed recipes with code-style error messages.

## What this is
- Every “recipe” reads like a bug report
- Everyone can contribute by adding a Markdown file

## Start here
- Browse the recipes: [Recipes](recipes.md)
- Add a new one: see [Contributing](contributing.md)

## Recipe format (quick)
Each recipe should include:
- **Error** (what failed)
- **Stack trace** (dramatic, fake is fine)
- **Fix attempt** (what you tried)
- **Postmortem** (lesson learned)
